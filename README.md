[Speed Clicking](https://www.speedclicking.com/) is a skill that is used in many games. It is the ability to click as
fast as possible.
And this repository is a codebase for a speed clicking game.

## How to play

The game is simple. You have 10 seconds to click as many times as possible, or you can set your own time.
Just click this [link](https://www.speedclicking.com/) and start clicking.

## Story

Making this clicking game was pretty fun, and the best part is it's getting popular day by day. I was wandering around
with some of my projects, and suddenly my brother appeared with his extraordinary idea .

He is a 14 years old kid, who plays Minecraft, and he loves doing it. I was just traveling towards his room and I got to
know he wants a feature to be added to a web app he uses to increase his Minecraft PVP skills; more specifically
clicking skills.

And I thought 'why not I develop it'? And then I developed it, and added those features that he wanted. Features like
fullscreen and a huge place to test his clicking speed. Also, I thought adding a dark mode toggling feature would be
awesome. And finally it was ready.

I hope you'd love this result of collaboration between me and my 14 years old brother.
